An AI-driven solution that accelerates loan approvals, reducing costs and streamlining operations for financial institutions and retailers. It enhances efficiency and delivers faster outcomes for customers.

This project won 2nd place at the [BÎ¿C Fintech Hackathon 5.0](https://bochackathon.com/en/)  (October 18-21, 2024).

I leveraged [Open AI Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm/) and multiple AI agents to optimize the loan approval process. These agents handle tasks such as information gathering, validation, enrichment, and final approval.
